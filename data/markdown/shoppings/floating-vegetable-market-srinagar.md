The Floating Vegetable Market is one of the **most unique and authentic experiences in Srinagar**, taking place on the calm waters of **Dal Lake** during the early morning hours. This centuries-old market is run entirely on boats, where local farmers and traders gather to sell fresh vegetables, fruits, flowers, and herbs directly from their traditional wooden **shikaras**.

The market usually begins **before sunrise**, creating a magical atmosphere with mist-covered waters, softly gliding boats, and lively negotiations between vendors. For travelers, it offers a rare opportunity to witness daily Kashmiri life that has remained largely unchanged for generations. The reflections of colorful produce and wooden boats make it a favorite spot for **photographers and culture enthusiasts**.

Unlike regular markets, transactions here happen boat-to-boat, without any permanent stalls. While it is primarily a wholesale market for locals, visitors are welcome to observe, take photos, and occasionally purchase small quantities. The experience is calm, immersive, and deeply rooted in Kashmir’s cultural heritage.
